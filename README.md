#### Deploy to heroku
- mongoDB worked fine locally
- website would not deploy. No console error. Checked terminal and had an app can't initiallize error
- tried installing browser security removing extension still didn't work
- found out that if I remove the CORS code the website would deploy but my homepage looping gallery would not work and the error was a CORS error
- checked my browser.js, env file, package.json, and server.js and could not find the issue

Decided to remove the CORS code and at have the website without the gallery
